# compassion
a collection of useless information to find patterns of compassion in chaos using a meaningless personality quiz to segment across 16 dimensions (a la Myers Briggs) for no reason other than the number 16 is very convenient to mathematic logic (personality tests are dumb).

## 256 (16 x 16)^3 colors of the rainbow
16,777,216 hex colors / 16 = over 1 million layers of depth to this chaos. When you begin the experience, you will complete an almost entirely useless quiz that will assign you - yes you! - a random hex color from 1/16th of the segment of the hex color rainbow. From there, you can answer more questions (up to a million, according to math but not according to my free time) to find your "complementary hex colors."

As you level up with "complementary" colors, you will fill in a randomized grid of 16 colors. Once your 16 color grid is complete, it will expand out to a grid within a grid, showing 15 more 16 color grids to complete. This will loop indefinitely.

Level 1 => 16 colors
Level 2 => 256 colors
Level 3 => 4096 colors
Level 4 => 65,536 colors
etc.

None of this is real science or tied to human behavior or personality in any meaningful way - we just love to classify and segment ourselves as humans, so why not play with that idea and make a complex color patchwork that really says nothing about who we are in reality?

## But doesn't it? üßê
This application will track your interaction and responses, but will not tie it to any personally identifiable information - no need to share your email, create an account, or even introduce yourself with a name. Everything will be stored anonymized and protected, and you can delete your information at any point by clicking the largest delete button I could manage to display.

## But why would you do that?
Remember when Walking Scrotum Martin Shkreli bought that Wu Tang album and kept it just for himself? This is kind of like that, but instead we are the making the album together and it is made up of all this useless human information and I won't share it with anyone - regardless of the ultimate value (maybe $0 idgaf) - unless you can directly profit from it and choose to do so. Let's see if we can build a human-owned co-op of governance over the monetary transactions with our personal information, but lets make it a dumb quiz and completely nihilistic. Hop in, loser, we are messing with Capitalism ü§ô

## That's a lot of dumb questions
Yes! And I always need more. If you have some dumb questions, I will make something to collect them but until then, hmu with your suggestions <a href="mailto:laurenliss@gmail.com?subject=some dumb questions for your nihilist problem">laurenliss@gmail.com</a>
